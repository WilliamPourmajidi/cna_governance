# Sample CNA Generated Data

This folder contains sample telemetry (metrics) and logs generated by the AWS and IBM Cloud-Native Applications (CNAs). These data samples are representative of the format and structure used in the multi-cloud CNA Governance Platform.

## Overview of Data Storage by the Archiver Component

Telemetry generated by CNAs is pushed to the implemented subset of the proposed reference architecture. The **Archiver** component, a critical element within the **RG-GOV-IMS** (Resource Group for data Ingestion, Manipulation, and Storage), manages the storage of telemetry and logs according to their data sensitivity and usage requirements. For further details on the implementation of this reference architecture, please refer to Section 5 (REAL-WORLD INSTANTIATION OF THE PROPOSED REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE) of the paper.

- **Metrics**: Stored in **mutable storage** as metrics serve a more operational purpose rather than digital evidence, offering flexibility in data management.
- **Logs**: Stored in **immutable storage** to fulfill tamper-proof and data integrity requirements. AWS S3 with Object Lock ensures that log data is secure against modification or deletion, supporting compliance and audit needs.

## Folder Structure

he folder structure reflects data separation by cloud provider and storage type, aligning with the governance platformâ€™s best practices. Each file follows a consistent naming convention:

`CSP-log_id.json`

- **CSP**: Indicates the Cloud Service Provider (either `aws` or `ibm`).
- **log_id**: Represents the unique identifier generated for each telemetry entry, ensuring traceability.

This naming convention aids in quick identification and retrieval of specific logs or telemetry data generated by the AWS and IBM CNAs:



- **`aws/immutable/`**: Contains immutable logs generated by the AWS CNA, stored in JSON format with object lock enabled. Files follow the naming convention `aws-<log_id>.json`.
- **`aws/mutable/`**: Stores mutable telemetry data generated by the AWS CNA, also in JSON format. Files follow the naming convention `aws-<log_id>.json`.
- **`ibm/immutable/`**: Contains immutable logs generated by the IBM CNA, stored in JSON format with object lock enabled. Files follow the naming convention `ibm-<log_id>.json`.
- **`ibm/mutable/`**: Stores mutable telemetry data generated by the IBM CNA in JSON format. Files follow the naming convention `ibm-<log_id>.json`.

Each file is named according to a standardized convention:

- **`CSP-log_id.json`**
    - **CSP**: Indicates the Cloud Service Provider (`aws` or `ibm`).
    - **log_id**: Represents the unique identifier for each telemetry entry, ensuring traceability.

This structure supports efficient organization and retrieval of logs and telemetry data generated by the AWS and IBM CNAs, following best practices in data governance.
